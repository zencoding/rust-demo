# rust-demo
Rust Demo for selected examples from Elements of Programming Interviews
The book contains a lot of algorithms but to me a lot of them are already solved by excellent libraries. For example a problem to multiple two integers represented as strings is meaningless since in real life you would just cast them to integers.  So this selection of problems are the one that make sense in real projects
